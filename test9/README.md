# Test9 Project Skeleton

This directory provides a minimal scaffold for experimenting with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for language models.

## Structure
- **data/**: placeholders for training, validation, and test data.
- **configs/**: sample configuration files for SFT, PPO, and reward modeling.
- **src/**: module stubs for data processing, models, rewards, and evaluation utilities.
- **src/training/**: trainer stubs for SFT and PPO workflows.
- **scripts/**: entry points for training, inference, and evaluation.

## Usage
Populate the data and configuration files, implement the module contents, then run the scripts to train and evaluate models.
